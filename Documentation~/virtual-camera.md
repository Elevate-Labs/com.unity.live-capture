# Using the Virtual Camera

* [Getting started](virtual-camera-getting-started.md)
* [Workflow](virtual-camera-workflow.md)
* [App controls and settings](virtual-camera-app-controls.md)
* [Virtual Camera Device](virtual-camera-device.md)

## Requirements

* PC running Windows or OSX.

* iPad with ARKit capabilities -- iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd gen or later), iPad mini (5th gen or later), or iPad (5th gen or later).

* Video streaming requires a PC running Windows 10 with a modern GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1060 or better is recommended though not required).

* Turn off AR to reposition around the physical space

* Camera **motion damping**

* **Motion scaling** to multiply physical motion
