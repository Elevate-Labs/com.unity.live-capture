# Getting Started

## Tracking tips

Tracking works best when the relative position of the head and device is fixed, as in the following scenarios:

* (Preferred) The device is mounted to the performer's head via a helmet.
* The device is mounted to a static surface and the performer does not move their head or look around.

In this case the **Head Position** and **Head Rotation** channels on the **ARKit Face Device** should be disabled.

## Samples

There are basic sample characters you can access by opening the **Package Manager** window, clicking on the **Live Capture** package, and importing the **ARKit Face Capture** sample.

## Setting up a character

See the documentation for the [Default Face Mapper](ref-component-arkit-default-face-mapper.md).
